# RESEARCH

**GitHub Field Day Nepal**, as the [official website](https://githubfieldday.com/np2024/) says, is an unconference for student leaders of Nepal facilitated by GitHub Education. In case you're unfamiliar with GitHub Education, its a program that will give you your **free domain**, your **IDEs premiums** and most importantly the **GitHub Copilot** while you're a student with the [GitHub Student Developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack/offers).

Throughout this blog some keywords used are:

- Fielder being a selected applicant.
- OC being the Organizing Committee.

# APPLY

The application opens once a year in the month of September and the applicant must be a student, pursuing any Bachelors degree in any university from Nepal. The **hidden qualifications** includes your contribution to the tech community around you, the challenges you've overcome to stand where you stand and the mass of the audience you represent with the leadership skills you posses. More than these the **most required** qualification for GitHub Field Day is the desire and the fire in you to solve the issues, you and your community is facing with the guidance from the mentors, the GitHub Campus Experts and the OCs of the Field Day Nepal.

You're required to answer some critical questions about your community so that the OCs can better understand your vision and your capability to represent where you come from. Additionally, a 1 minute long video of you is required, with no fancy editing, to answer some of the queries OCs might have with you and your plans to address the challenges in your community. This might seem like the hardest part but trust me, its all worth it when you see that `Congratulations üëè Fielder, You're Selected for GitHub Field Day Nepal ‚òÇÔ∏è` mail, for giving that extra push to 100 and 1 percent where others gave up.

# EXPERIENCE

Firsts things first, everything is free. The program is free to participate at the Grand German Homes, the üòã delicious ü§§ mouth watering ü´£ eye savory food is free to munch in and the travel and accomodations are free to ease the journey of Fielders outside the kathmandu valley.

## Discussions

The event is divided into 3 sections, each section being the **Unconference** where the Fielders are divided into groups and are given a topic to discuss and present their ideas on. The topics are usually the challenges faced by the community and the solutions that can be implemented to overcome them. The discussions are usually led by the GitHub Campus Experts and the OCs of the Field Day Nepal.

What can I say, GitHub Field Day is the '**Purba Paschim Rail**' that KP Oli wanted to build. You get new friends from East-to-West, who all are tech-savvy and leaders in their own community. You get multiple GitHub Campus Experts in your friend list üòâ, possibly you get Jobs and Internships from the new connections you make and the best of all, you could get your future Co-founders and partners from this network. The opportunities are limitless.

## Things to Remember

- **OCs are as Ted Lasso Says, Be Curious Not Judgemental**: Ask questions, even if you think they're silly. The more you share, the more you learn.
- **Enjoy Everything**: Be on time, be it the discussions, the meals or the dance party. You don't want to miss the fun. Ask the Photographer dai to take your photos the most, you'll thank me later.
- **Returning Home**: The event concludes at around 5 PM, but the accomodations are not provided for the night after the event. So, make sure you have your travel plans ready.
